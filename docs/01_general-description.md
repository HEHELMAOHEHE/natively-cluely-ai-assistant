## 1. General Description and Key Features

Natively is a free, privacy-focused desktop AI assistant for meetings, interviews, presentations, and professional conversations. The project positions itself as an open-source alternative to commercial solutions like Cluely, but with an emphasis on local data processing and full user control over their API keys.

Key Features:

- Real-time: transcription, analysis, and response generation happen during the meeting
- Platform Support: works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, and other applications
- Local-first: all data is stored and processed exclusively on the user's device
- No Telemetry: no analytics collected, behavior not tracked
- Flexible AI Providers: support for multiple cloud and local AI models

Key Highlights:

- Local RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): local vector database for searching meeting history ("What did John say about API last week?")
- Dual Audio Channel: separate processing of system audio (interlocutors) and microphone (user)
- Screenshot Analysis: understanding slides, code, diagrams, and other visual materials
- Stealth Mode: ability to disguise as system utilities (Terminal, Activity Monitor)
- Fully Customizable Hotkeys: global shortcuts for interface control

Design Principles:

- Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK): user provides their own API keys for Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers
- 100% Open Source: AGPL-3.0 license
- Unlimited Usage: no subscriptions, paid plans, or hidden fees
- Data Control: neither audio, transcripts, nor screenshots leave the device without explicit user consent

Use Cases:

- Technical Interviews: help with formulating answers, reminders about concepts
- Sales and Client Calls: quick product information retrieval, interaction history
- Daily Standups: automatic notes, task extraction
- Training and Lectures: translation, explanation of complex topics, material analysis
- Programming: debugging help, code explanation, solution suggestions

Natively is designed to enhance productivity in professional environments while maintaining maximum privacy and data control.
